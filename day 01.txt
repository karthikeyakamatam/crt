the default data type of decimal is double


TYPE CASTING :	manaual
TYPE CONVERSION: automatic

*method is always attached to object whereas function is independent
in java there is no function (every function is created inside class not independent)

*main indicates start of the program

*in a project if there are n files then all no need main function for all only one needs main function

*prototype--structure of program

*we should give main because it is called by compiler which is out of package so we use public other than default , private and protected

*STATIC--we give static main so we need not create object for the main method

*we cannot access the static method outside of the class
 so use classname.methodname

*we use the same name for classname and file name in IDE(integrated development) environment

*  .class files created for each class
   for example in program 5 classes are there implies it will create 5 .class files

** java is platform independent but JVM is platform  dependent
*JIT(just in time )compiler is the compiler used by java

DATATYPE:

** in C lang float allows 7 decimals and double allows 14 decimals
**type modifier such as short , long  , signed , unsigned in C lang


*in java we have no type modifier instead for intger we have
  byte-1 byte(256-->>-128 to 127)
  short-2 bytes(65536-->> -32768 to 32767)
  int-4 bytes
  long-8 bytes

*primitive datatypes
  Boolean, int ,


**string is not a primitive datatype
  String is not a key  word it is built in class
 (in java built in class start with cap letter)

*we use various notations like snake notation(under score) and camel notation(start with small and every second word is cap)  



**variable types--1.Instance variable  2.local 3.static  4.final
1.Instance variable: is a variable created inside the class but outside of any method
  can be defined any where inside the class(before or after or between thew methods)
 *the instance variables can be used without assigning a value where it procceds with default value(for int 0, for string null, for Boolean false)

2.local variable: created inside method. 
  **it is never assigned with default value
   *it cannot be used without assigning a value

3.static variable:

  ** only instance variables can be static (local cannot be static)

4.final variable : it is used to create constants

  *final variable must be initialized for instance(for local it must be assigned )
  *both instance and local variable can be made final
**instance and static does not bind with the object



afternoon:

TAKING INPUT IN JAVA:

1.import java.util.Scanner
2.use Scanner varible = new Scanner(System.in);

*using space  or enter implies completed reading one data value in java


questions : 
1. MCQ (programming , dbms ,os , cn) 
2. sudeo code (MCQ based **bitwiswe operators ,string based concepts , )  
3. Automata Fix (they give -- problem statement ,test cases , solutions)--hexaware company uses only this
4. Coding (given ---> problem statement , test cases , driving code)
5. project based (for certifications like java full stack)

OPERATORS: an operator is a symbol used to perform either mathematical operation or logical operation
**mathematical operations returns diff output for diff inputs whereas logical operators returns the Boolean values

TYPES OF OPERATORS:
1.Arithemtic (+ , * , / , - , // , ** )

2.Increment or decrement operator  (++ , --)  **python do not have increment and decrement

3.Assigment operator (= , += , -= ,*= , &= , ^=)
(mathematical operators)

1.Relattional( < , > , <= , >= , == , !=)

2.Logical (&& , || , !)

3.Bitwise(& , | , ^ , ~ , << , >>)

4.conditional( ? , :)
(logical operators)

 Q: problem statment-- 
     given a positive four digit integer 'n' check whether it is happy number or not 
     (happy number : a number is happy number if product of last tow digits is equal to sum of remaning digits)






****coding questions
  1.bit manipulation
  2.number theory based
  3.patterns
  4.arrays
  5.strings

**how to remove last digit from given number --  use %  
 *how to extract the last digit from given number -- use /
 * how to append two numbers -- find digits count of other number and use number*(int)Math.pow(10,digitscount) and add that number
 * how to find number of digits in a number  -- use log function of base 10  the no.of digits ==log10N +1


Q;2:  given a positive intger 'n' your task is swap first digit with last digit
